The two person hangman game can be played on a desktop/laptop, pad or phone. 

To play the game, open the index.html file under the hangman-game-master directory. To start a game, you have 
two choices, you can either input your own word for another person to guess or let the word be chosen for you at random(the two buttons on the top). You can then guess the word by clicking the letters below. 

If a letter is correct, all instances of that letter in the word will appear. If it's wrong, a body part of the hangman will appear. In this game, you have a maximum of 6 incorrect tries. At any point in the game, you can reset
it, which resets your tries for the current word, or start a new game by selecting random word or by inputting a 
new word for the user to guess.
